**Motivation**

**Problem Statement: 
“How have environmental factors (air quality, water and waste management, and land cover changes) impacted long-term sustainability in Australia, and what strategies can be proposed to enhance environmental resilience?”**

•	We were given datasets on air pollution, water and waste management, and land cover data, covering various periods and regions within Australia.

•	I wanted to examine the effectiveness of current environmental management practices and propose strategies to improve sustainability outcomes in Australia.



**Summary of the Analysis** 

•	Performed data cleaning and pre-processing in the dataset by using Excel before feeding the entire dataset in Tableau for analysis.

•	Perform a comparison of Black Carbon, Organic Carbon, Carbon Monoxide, Surplus Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxide, NMVO, and Ammonia by using a double-axis line chart over 30 years from 1990-2019.

•	Identified that middle and high-income countries contribute significantly to global pollution, with China and India being major contributors.

•	Showed waste generation by different industries and waste types in Australia, with manufacturing, construction, and households as the top contributors.

•	Displayed water consumption in Australia by sector, with electricity, gas, water, and waste services consuming the most.

•	Visualized the changes in land cover, highlighting the increase in artificial surfaces, particularly in populated states.

•	Showed the decline in natural vegetation, indicating a loss of habitat and biodiversity.
